* issue
** spconv build error in dockerfile
In the last step of the official, build is finished when spconv is imported from python firstly.
But this step error when add the following in dockerfile:
#+begin_src 
  RUN python -m spconv
#+end_src

The reason is that nvidia-smi is needed in spconv buiding, while nvidia-smi is imported after container started through import
nvidia driver.
*** the temporal method is: finishing the spconv building in the container, then commit the container as new image.
* usage
** see [[*the temporal method is: finishing the spconv building in the container, then commit the container as new image.][using temporal method]]
** start container
#+begin_src bash
  docker compose run --rm querydet /bin/bash
#+end_src
